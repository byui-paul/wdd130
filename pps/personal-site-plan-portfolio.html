      <h3>Why This Developer?</h3>
      <p>
        Over the years I have refined my skills and I am able to assist my
        clients draw the blueprint of what they want. I help them to form 
        a conceptual view of what they want developed. As an experienced 
        full stack web developer, I meet deadlines and deliver websites to clients 
        before in good time.  Futhermore, comparing myself with other developers
        I am relatively cheep. My services are affordable and therefore any wish 
        may be transformed to a reality and a very low cost.
