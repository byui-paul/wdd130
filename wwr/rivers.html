                    Transport yourself into the mountains and true wilderness of Idaho’s Main Salmon River, where big water splashes, 
                    warm sandy beaches, and rugged scenery fill your multi-day river trip. The adventure of travelling with family or
                    friends deeper into the river canyons each day, while camping at night under clear starry skies, is a unique 
                    experience that is sure to create memories that last a lifetime.

                    The Salmon River weaves a story of early explorers, deep wilderness, and a free-flowing river into your relaxing
                    vacation days. Flowing through Idaho’s Frank Church River of No Return wilderness area, the largest tract of a 
                    protected wild landscape in the lower 48 states, the Main Salmon River features class III big-water rapids in a 
                    stunning wilderness canyon. Main Salmon river rafting in Idaho is the perfect wilderness journey for all kinds of 
                    adventure-seekers. The Main Salmon’s big-water rapids and sandy beaches provide both incredible white water rapids 
                    and the perfect relaxing escape all in one.

                    Full Canyon trips cover both the Upper and Lower sections of the river – 225 river miles. 
                    From the Roaring 20s to Lava Falls you won’t miss any of the Canyon’s rapids or secrets. 
                    There is ample time to adjust to river life during the first half of these two week trips, 
                    setting you up to really take advantage of the experience. Each day, you’ll be more at home in 
                    the Canyon’s environment. By the time we get to the really big white water, you’ll be ready to 
                    hit these house sized waves!
